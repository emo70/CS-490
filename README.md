Tasked to create a grading system where users can login as a student or a teacher to perform specific tasks. The instructor can create questions to the question bank and use those questions to create exams.  Students can take those exams and instructor can update/release those results to the student after reviewing it. This was a three person job (front-end, middle-end, and back-end). I was tasked to create the database where user information is stored and creating php scripts so certain functions could be executed to store that information.

Software used:
  XAMPP
  Visual Studio Code
  MobaXterm
